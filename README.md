## Kotlin Smith Number 🎬 2️⃣ 📗

![Kotlin Smith Number](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*rgUu5-sCYn24KBnGDs0f5g.png)

A `Smith number` is a composite number whose sum of digits in its prime factorization is equal to the sum of digits in the number itself. 

For example, `85` is a Smith number because:
85 = 5 x 17 (prime factorization) sum of digits in 85 = 8 + 5 = 13 sum of digits in 5 + 1 + 7 = 13

Here is a program in `Kotlin` that finds all the Smith numbers within a given range:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val range = 1..100
    println("Smith numbers between ${range.first} and ${range.last}:")
    range.filter { isSmithNumber(it) }.forEach(::println)
}

fun isSmithNumber(num: Int): Boolean {
    return if (num < 4) false
    else sumOfDigits(num) == primeFactors(num).sumOf { sumOfDigits(it) }
}

fun primeFactors(n: Int): List<Int> {
    var number = n
    val factors = mutableListOf<Int>()
    var i = 2
    while (i <= number) {
        while (number % i == 0) {
            factors.add(i)
            number /= i
        }
        i++
    }
    return factors
}

fun sumOfDigits(n: Int): Int {
    return n.toString().sumOf { it - '0' }
}
```
The `main` function sets a range for which Smith numbers are to be found, and loops through each number in the range. If a number is found to be a Smith number, it is printed to the console.

The `isSmithNumber` function checks whether a given number is a Smith number. It first checks if the number is less than 4, in which case it cannot be a composite number and therefore cannot be a Smith number. It then calculates the sum of digits in the number itself and in its prime factors, and returns `true` if the two sums are equal.

The `primeFactors` function returns a list of prime factors of a given number. It loops through each number from 2 to the square root of the given number, checking if each number is a factor. If a number is a factor, it is added to the list of factors and the given number is divided by it. If the given number is still greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the list of factors as well.

The `sumOfDigits` function returns the sum of digits in a given number. It loops through each digit in the number, adding it to a running sum.

Note that this program assumes that the given range starts from 1 and goes up to 100, but this can be easily modified by changing the values of `start` and `end` in the `main` function.

When we run the program, it will output all the smith numbers up to the limit we set:

```kotlin
