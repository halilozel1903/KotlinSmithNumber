![Kotlin Smith Number](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*rgUu5-sCYn24KBnGDs0f5g.png)

A `Smith number` is a composite number whose sum of digits in its prime factorization is equal to the sum of digits in the number itself. 

For example, `85` is a Smith number because:
85 = 5 x 17 (prime factorization) sum of digits in 85 = 8 + 5 = 13 sum of digits in 5 + 1 + 7 = 13

Here is a program in `Kotlin` that finds all the Smith numbers within a given range:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val start = 1
    val end = 100
    println("Smith numbers between $start and $end:")
    for (i in start..end) {
        if (isSmithNumber(i)) {
            println(i)
        }
    }
}

fun isSmithNumber(n: Int): Boolean {
    if (n < 4) {
        return false
    }
    val digitsSum = sumOfDigits(n)
    val factorsSum = primeFactors(n).map { sumOfDigits(it) }.sum()
    return digitsSum == factorsSum
}

fun primeFactors(n: Int): List<Int> {
    var num = n
    val factors = mutableListOf<Int>()
    var i = 2
    while (i <= num / i) {
        while (num % i == 0) {
            factors.add(i)
            num /= i
        }
        i++
    }
    if (num > 1) {
        factors.add(num)
    }
    return factors
}

fun sumOfDigits(n: Int): Int {
    var num = n
    var sum = 0
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10
        num /= 10
    }
    return sum
}
```
The `main` function sets a range for which Smith numbers are to be found, and loops through each number in the range. If a number is found to be a Smith number, it is printed to the console.

The `isSmithNumber` function checks whether a given number is a Smith number. It first checks if the number is less than 4, in which case it cannot be a composite number and therefore cannot be a Smith number. It then calculates the sum of digits in the number itself and in its prime factors, and returns `true` if the two sums are equal.

The `primeFactors` function returns a list of prime factors of a given number. It loops through each number from 2 to the square root of the given number, checking if each number is a factor. If a number is a factor, it is added to the list of factors and the given number is divided by it. If the given number is still greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the list of factors as well.

The `sumOfDigits` function returns the sum of digits in a given number. It loops through each digit in the number, adding it to a running sum.

Note that this program assumes that the given range starts from 1 and goes up to 100, but this can be easily modified by changing the values of `start` and `end` in the `main` function.

When we run the program, it will output all the smith numbers up to the limit we set:

```kotlin
Smith numbers between 1 and 100:
4
5
7
11
13
17
19
22
23
27
29
31
37
